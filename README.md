# Database Programming with SQL

This document serves as a beginner's guide to database programming using SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases[1]. It is used to store, query, and manipulate data in a relational database[3].

## Introduction to SQL

SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data in a relational database[3]. SQL allows you to execute queries, retrieve data, insert records, update records, delete records, create new databases and tables, create stored procedures and views, and set permissions on tables[1]. SQL is the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

SQL enables users to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on relational databases[7].

The most common SQL statements include:
*   **SELECT**: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
*   **INSERT**: Adds new data into a table.
*   **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data in a table.
*   **DELETE**: Removes data from a table.

A basic `SELECT` statement consists of the following[2]:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

*   `SELECT` specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the table.
*   `FROM` specifies the table you want to retrieve data from.
*   `WHERE` (optional) specifies the conditions for filtering the data.

## Modifying Data

SQL allows modification of data stored in a database[2].

To add new data into a table, use the `INSERT` statement[2]:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

This statement inserts a new row into `table_name` with the specified values for `column1`, `column2`, and so on[2].
